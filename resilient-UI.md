## takeaways

- 功能&价值：UIs should adapt to the functionality they can offer, whilst still providing value to users;
- 错误预判/分类：Always think what can wrong (never make assumptions); Categorize errors based on their impact (not all errors are equal);
- 错误预防：Preventing errors is better than responding to them (code defensively);
- 回滚：When facing an error, ask whether a recovery or fallback is available;
- User facing error messages should provide **actionable prompts**;
- Engineers must have **visibility** on errors (use error monitoring services);
- Error messages for engineers/ colleagues should be **meaningful** and **provide context**;
- **Learn from errors** to help our future selves and others.
